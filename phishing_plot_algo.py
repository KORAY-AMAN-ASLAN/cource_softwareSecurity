"""
The script employs machine learning (ML) models to classify email texts into 'Legitimate' or 'Phishing' categories,
 focusing on the probability of an email being phishing. Utilizing Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
 and Gradient Boosting models, it predicts and visualizes the likelihood of phishing for given email examples.
  This process illustrates how ML can be applied to cybersecurity,
  specifically in automating the detection and analysis of phishing threats.

Workflow:
1. Load Pre-trained ML Models:
The models, trained on labeled datasets distinguishing phishing from legitimate emails,
are loaded to evaluate new texts.

2. Classify Example Emails:
Two emails are classifiedâ€”one simulating a legitimate service provider's message and the other mimicking a phishing attempt.
These examples help demonstrate the models' ability to assess and differentiate email types based on learned patterns.

3. Predict and Convert Probabilities:
For each text, the models predict the probability of being phishing.
These predictions are converted to percentages to simplify interpretation,
aiming to reflect realistic scenarios where phishing emails might show high probabilities (e.g., 97%),
 while legitimate ones show significantly lower probabilities (e.g., 33% or 55%).

4. Terminal Output and Visualization:
Classification probabilities for each email and model are printed to the terminal,
providing immediate insight into each model's evaluation. Furthermore,
the script generates bar plots to visually compare the models' assessments, enhancing the comparative analysis.

5. Insightful Comparative Analysis:
By analyzing the output and visualizations, users can observe how different models rate the same texts,
offering valuable perspectives on model performance, reliability, and suitability for phishing detection tasks.

This approach not only highlights the practical application of ML in identifying phishing attempts but also showcases,
 the nuanced capabilities of different models, contributing to the development of effective, AI-driven solutions for email security.
