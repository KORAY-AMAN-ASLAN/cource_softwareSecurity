# Email Classification Web App

This Python script creates a web application using Flask to classify email text as either legitimate or phishing. It leverages machine learning models pre-trained to detect phishing characteristics within email content. The integration of NLP, ML, and web development offers an interactive platform for email classification.

## Key Components and Workflow

1. **Library Imports:** Starts with importing necessary libraries for web development, data manipulation, NLP, machine learning, and optional visualization.

2. **Model Loading:** Loads pre-trained models for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

3. **Email Text Preprocessing:** Defines a function to clean and normalize email texts for accurate predictions.

4. **Data Loading and Preprocessing for Training:** Automates the loading and preprocessing of new training data.

5. **Model Training with Hyperparameter Optimization:** Details the training process with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

6. **Flask Web Application Setup:** Explains setting up a web application with Flask to handle GET and POST requests for classification.

7. **Results Visualization and Output:** Discusses extending the script for result visualization using matplotlib.

8. **Execution and Model Management:** Describes the script’s main block for model training, saving, and web application running.
