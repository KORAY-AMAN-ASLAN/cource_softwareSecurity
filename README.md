## Project Context

This project originates from a cybersecurity course at Mid Sweden University, where I explored the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models for the detection of phishing emails. The aim was to develop and test these models' effectiveness in identifying phishing attempts and implement a Flask web application for real-time email classification. 

## Project Visuals

Below are visuals demonstrating key aspects of the project:

1. **Web Application Interface**: The Flask-based web interface used for real-time email classification.
