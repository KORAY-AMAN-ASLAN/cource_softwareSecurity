## Project Context

This project originates from a cybersecurity course at Mid Sweden University, where I explored the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models for the detection of phishing emails. The aim was to develop and test these models' effectiveness in identifying phishing attempts and implement a Flask web application for real-time email classification. Additionally, matplotlib was used to create plots for comparative analysis of the models' performance. This hands-on project showcases the practical application of combining NLP, ML, and web development to enhance cybersecurity measures.
